Sprint number: Sprint 4
Name of the .cs file being reviewed:The DugeonHUD.cs 
Author of the .cs file being reviewed:Cong Liu
Specific comments on code quality: In most functions of the Dugeon file, the code looks cohesive and little couple. But some variables or properties in this file can be put into other files in this sprint
, like 'firstpicked', this is not really helpful for us to knwon what it really mean. And for the draw function, I think most of them can be written in the level class.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
I think write down the draw function into other files is available, and it really does work for leveling up the maintainability. Since I am writting the gamestate class in this sprint, I need to just use draw 
function for some classes, but in the world state, I need to draw all the things in it(including HUD and level draw functions), so just put HUD draw function into the level class has the same results but it 
can improve the maintainability.
