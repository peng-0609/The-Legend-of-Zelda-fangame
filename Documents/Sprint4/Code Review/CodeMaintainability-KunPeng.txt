Specific comments on code quality
These classes separate objects' physical attributes from the object classes, which not only simplify object classes but are also easy to edit.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
If Link needs a new physical property, we can just add thid property to the LinkPhysicalProperty class and initialize it in the constructor.
