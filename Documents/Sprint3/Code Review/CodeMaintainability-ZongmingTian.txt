Sprint number: Sprint 3
Name of the .cs file being reviewed:All the CollisionHandler.cs files.
Author of the .cs file being reviewed:Xiaochen Feng
Specific comments on code quality: In each class, just using one test function to test if collison handles; If collison happens, it will use the collided function from the entity classes,
and then update the location. I think it has low maintainability, since if some parts of codes have problem, you should first make sure whether it is the test part has the problem or 
updating location part has the problem, then you should just modify that part and also make sure the other part can still run after rewritting code.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
I think the coder can divide the test functions into three parts-test,collision handling, and updating location. If it is done in this way, people will easily see where the error is,
and modify it. I think it is very easy to be achieved,many other groups write the collision class files in this way.
