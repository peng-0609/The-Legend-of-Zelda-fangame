Specific comments on code quality: It isolated the codes to three parts, inialize the instance and spritesheet, and then load all the textures, finally create spritesheet. So I think
the efficiency is maximizing in these classes, the running time for this class is only creating sprite time, don't have other trivialous steps. Because the functions are very simple, 
it is also easy to maintain the correctnesss; However, the if the code is changed to a new environment, the code needs to change a lot, since it will need to use AnimateSpritesheet 
or NonAnimateSprite. 
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
The change I want to make is to move the sprite class all in the same directory or create the sprite and drawing function inside the class to increase the maintainability, but this 
is hard to achieve, since there are lots of other files still need to use sprite class, and they need to classified each class into their own folder.
