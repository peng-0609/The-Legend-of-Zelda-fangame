Sprint number: 2
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: Link.cs and all calsses under items folder
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Kun Peng
Specific comments on code quality: Overall, the code quality is good and meets the requirement of Sprint 2. The classes use state pattern to make them easily to swicth 
different states. They only implement the methods defined in the interface which makes it look very concise.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
I think the Direction enum in the Link.cs can be extrated to a single file that includes all the enums that might be used now and in the future.  And I think the current 
implementation could easily support that change.
