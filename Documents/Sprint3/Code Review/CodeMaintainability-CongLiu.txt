Date of the code review: 10/18
Sprint number: 3
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: ResetCommand.cs and MouseController.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Weiyi Jiang
Specific comments on code quality: It is easily to see some code reuse between the ResetCommand.cs and MouseController.cs. I can see you want to reload other rooms
in the level and reinitialize the controller list and collision handler. But their code are almost the same. Also, there is code reuse between MouseController.cs and 
BackgroundSprite.cs because they are very similar in the roomSource dictionary.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
I would recommend to merge the similar code or include them in one file.
