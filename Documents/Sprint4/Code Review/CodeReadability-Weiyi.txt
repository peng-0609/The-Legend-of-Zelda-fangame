Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: For the code, there is comment explaining the meaning of the variable. As for SoundFactory and HUDFactory, it is formulaic and no
other logic. As for the Music factory, there is a boolean variable IsRepeating to let it broadcast multiple times. Besides, there is a Resume function to let it go back after suspending.
