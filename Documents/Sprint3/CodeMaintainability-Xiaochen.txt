Specific comments on code quality: 

The class has a high cohesion and does not have code smells.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed
and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

In the implementation, the main class connects all the object throught the game. 
Through the initialation, the class initialize all the needed variable at the beginning using IList,
and then use for each loop to update and draw. The structure is very clear and make evey part isolated with each other.
Therefore, I think the code quality is very good.
