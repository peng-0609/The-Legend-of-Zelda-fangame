Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: You add some codes handling the situation where the game mode is OneHp Mode and Unlimited Mode.
They are some simple codes and are easy to understand. You also tweak the handling Link's health part and it seems to be not buggy anymore. Compared
the straight-forward way you wrote the code before, I belive this new one would be easier to read.
