Sprint 2

File: all cs file under Enemies and Item
Author of these .cs file:  Xiaochen Feng & Kun Peng
Comments on code quality:
By this sprint, all of the enemy  and item classes should work fine. The enemy files works as a classes to inherite from IEnemy interface.
The item files work as a class to inherite from IItem interface. 
The file uses Enemy() and Item() method to construct different types of enemies and items. Also, the file uses Draw(SpriteBatch spriteBatch) method 
that was inheritted from IEnemy to draw with spriteBatch, at a given location 'spriteLocation'.  It should be take care that in the enemy file it 
uses  Draw(SpriteBatch spriteBatch), however, in the item file it uses Draw(SpriteBatch spriteBatch, Vector2 location), which is a little bit different.
Currently this is a very good way of implement and organize enemy and its methods. For enemy it has right state and enough function for moveup and
down, left or right. It should be careful that each different enemy may have different function, and he cares about it.
As for Item file, it is simple cause it only has state and update and draw cause it is stateless.
As far as I am concerned, right now it can support all changes and implementation. However, as we do much more about enemy, there might be slight
change about it cause right now enemey do not move and we do cannot see error.
