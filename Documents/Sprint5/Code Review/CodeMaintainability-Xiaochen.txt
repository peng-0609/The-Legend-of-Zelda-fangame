The class has a high cohesion and does not have code smells. Also, in sprint 5, we added two more different playing mode.
And the modification is based on the original GameStateManager. Therefore, I think the code quality is good.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed
and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

Since the changes are based on the previous version of game state class. So, the current implementation should support well.
And most of changes in game state are also related on game state manager. Therefore, if something goes wrong, we can find easily
based on the previous experience.
