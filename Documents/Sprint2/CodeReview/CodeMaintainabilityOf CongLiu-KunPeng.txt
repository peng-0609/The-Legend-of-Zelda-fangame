Specific comments on code quality:
All codes are written in a clear way and all variables names are in the same form. Since it is easy to find the method to be modified,
I believe the code is of high maintainability.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
If a new sprite sheet is added, just load the sheet in LoadAllTextures() and write a new constructor.
