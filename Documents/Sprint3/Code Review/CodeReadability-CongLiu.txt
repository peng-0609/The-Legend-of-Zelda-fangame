Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: The collisions files are very readable because their method names clearly indicate what the collisions happen between. But I would say
there may be lots of collisons that can be combined because sometimes I would be confused by the door, water, block, wall when I was writing my code. Also, I think it may lack some collisons
like the collision between Enemy and Projectile.
