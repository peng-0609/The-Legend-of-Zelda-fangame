Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: It is still readable, since all the variables are presented in the class, and the function and variable name is easy to understand. 
But sometimes I will find it is hard to understand what the author's idea is; In loadContent function, sometimes author will construct and add class into list, sometimes it will just add
vector directly. In Reset function, it copies all the loadcontent and initialization to the functions.
