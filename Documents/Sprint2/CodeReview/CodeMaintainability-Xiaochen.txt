Specific comments on code quality: 

The class has a high cohesion and does not have any code smells.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed
and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

In the implementation, the main class connects all the object throught the game. 
Through the initialation, it allows game to prepare well when it starts.
And in Enemy and Link object, it avoid using public field instead of private field to make 
the code in loosely coupling. I think the code quality is quitely nice.
