Date of the code review: 12/2
Sprint number: 4
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: GameOverState.cs, GamePausingState.cs, GameTransitionPausingState.cs, MenuState
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Zongming Tian
Specific comments on code quality: For this sprint, I see there are some modifications and tweaks to the several game states. For example, you change the restart to enable 
players can be back to the menu and select the mode they want to play after game ends, wchich I think can add more game experience and convenience. Also, since we add several
new modes to the game, you adjust some parts to fit them. But I can there are some code being reused and may be removed. Since we will set the boolean value of Unlimited to true 
in the UnlimitedState constructor, there are some places that don't need to reset the value.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
So far, I think it would be very easy and convenient if we want to add some new game modes. For the code reuse part, you can jusy simply remove them.
