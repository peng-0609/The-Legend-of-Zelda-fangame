Sprint2 reflection
It didn’t take a long time for our team to breakthrough the run-in period before this sprint, so 
at the beginning we soon made a clear schedule and task assignments. During the last three 
weeks, we also finished every phase on time. We all agreed that we did a perfect teamwork
altogether except that we eventually didn’t use the Board from Azure, since we were still not 
familiar with this website. As an alternative, our schedule is briefly listed as follow:
09/11	Sprint2 assigned
09/13	Discussion on what to do with the project
09/16	Tasks assigned to each team member:
		Xiaochen Feng: Enemies classes, states and related interfaces
		Weiyi Jiang: Sprite classes, sprite factory classes and related interfaces together with Cong Liu; sprite sheets edition, main class
		Cong Liu: Sprite classes, sprite factory classes and related interfaces together with Weiyi Jiang
		Kun Peng: Link, items classes, states and related interfaces
		Zongming Tian: Command, controller classes and related interfaces, main class
09/16~09/22		Most of the project finished
09/22~09/27		Refactoring, integration and debugging; final reflection and summary of the sprint
We did some improvements on the project which made it more constructive. For instance, at 
first we didn’t notice that spacing between sprites with different width or height might affect 
the display of the objects, so we re-edited the sprite sheets and the display became more natural. 
Additionally, we used sprite factory to make codes simple and more readable.
There were also shortcomings of our team. The most noteworthy one was the lack of 
use of functions in Azure Devops. We tried to put our tasks on the Board at the very beginning, but 
we failed to update or modify our schedule in time probably because we still haven’t formed a 
habit using this platform to record our works. We believed that in the future sprints we would 
have a better command of using Azure.
