To finish Sprint4, our team started earlier than before and had clearer division of work. We also had our first in-class code review
for this sprint, which we thought was very helpful.
We added HUD and menu to the game and simply increased the screen's height, which was different with the original game.
This change made it convenient to modify the coordinates of all of our objects. We also used one camera to move the game background
and the other one to move the whole menu.
In the final sprint, we might continue modifying enemy's properties.
