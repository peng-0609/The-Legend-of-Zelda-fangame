Notes On Code Analysis
----------------
There are 0 error, 179 warnings according to the rule set 'Microsoft Basic Design Guideline Rules'. Most of them are recommandations 
of renaming variables such as 'x', 'y' which represents positions. The rule set cannot recognize terms such as enemies names. A few 
warnings about unused variables are fixed by commenting these variables, since they will be used in the future.

There are still some warnings that we don't understand. We pick some of them and list as following:

Severity	Code	Description	Project	File	Line	Suppression State
