Sprint number: 5
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: LinkDoorCollision.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Xiaochen Feng
Specific comments on code quality: The new version of LinkDoorCollision is clear and simple which manages to deal with collisions
under 3 different door states.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
If there is a new condition we should deal with, we can simply add a case to the switch part.
