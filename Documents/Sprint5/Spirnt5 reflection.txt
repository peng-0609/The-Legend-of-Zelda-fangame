Our team worked quite smoothly during the final sprint. Since we only had minor problems after Sprint4, it didn't take long to fix the bugs.
Furthermore, we also designed and implemented several new features together. We added cheat code, 1 HP mode and unlimited mode to the game.
Since we worked together, there was no clear work division on the Board.
In conclusion, we all had good experience working with each other.
