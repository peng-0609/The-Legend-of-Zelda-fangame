Specific comments on code quality: 

The class has a high cohesion and does not have code smells.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed
and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

The construction is easy to understand and he current implementation can 
be easily modified since there are not much connection with other classes.
The structure is very clear and make evey part isolated with each other.
Therefore, I think the code quality is very good.
