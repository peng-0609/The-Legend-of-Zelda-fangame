Name of the .cs file being reviewed:Level.cs and MouseController.cs

Number of minutes taken to complete the review: About 5 minutes
Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: For the level.cs file, the code is easy to read because the function is divided into different kinds and each function
uses the function from the other entity classes. But in mousecontroller class, many variables are created without any comments, so it will take sometimes to understand what those 
variables mean.
