In this sprint, our team managed to combine Azue Devops with our work which enabled us to follow up each other's phases in time. As is 
shown in the Board, we worked on and finished more tasks during the second half period of the sprint. Though the reason might be that
we needed to unite the whole project smoothly after we've finished most of the works, we still needed to allocate the time more properly.
Besides the required objects such as collision, item loading with files, movement and level, we also re-wrote Link's decorator classes
and some of Link's states as the improvement of Sprint2. Additionally, we modified interfaces and classes of enemies and items so as 
to fit newly added functions in Sprint3.
One of the problems we encountered was the unbalanced work assignment for this sprint. We found that there were too much work with 
collision for only one team member to finish so we re-assigned the tasks to two persons instead.
