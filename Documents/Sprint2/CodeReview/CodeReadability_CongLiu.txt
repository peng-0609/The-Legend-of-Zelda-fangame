Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: Overall, the Game1.cs class was written well. The methods and fileds all have meaningful names.
But the use of public field is not a good practice. And I think there are too many repeated variables that can be refined. Also, in the Reset methods, the lines 
of code are too long and repeated which can be improved in the future.
