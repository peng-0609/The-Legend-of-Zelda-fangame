Specific comments on what is readable and what is not

Everything is readable within the code including method headers and bodies.
Method names are really straight forward and method bodies are all very cohesive.
All the methods to create new sprite and loading content are descriptive and concise.

Overall, the structure is very nice and easy to read.
