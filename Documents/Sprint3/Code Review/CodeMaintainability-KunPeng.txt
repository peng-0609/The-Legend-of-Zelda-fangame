Specific comments on code quality
This factory clearly divided each item's loading by their types into several methods, which was efficient to edit if we had problem with certain parts.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
If we need to load a new type of objects, we can simply initialize a new list of this type, add another case in CreateGameObjects() and write a new method to add specific objects into the list.
